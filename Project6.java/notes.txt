Part 2 Notes:
2.5: After inputting the given input, the display for the array showed the correct array
     for the first 5 numbers entered (1 2 3 4 5). In the exception field, the exception 
     message for the ArrayIndexOutOfBounds showed. This is evidence that the while loop 
     ran correctly for the first 5 tokens, which it had the dedicated room for, but after 
     the first 5, the try catch block found an exception (ArrayIndexOutOfBounds), stopped
     running the block, and displayed that message. Although there was a double that was
     entered, the first exception that was caught was the one that stopped the loop and
     displayed the message.
